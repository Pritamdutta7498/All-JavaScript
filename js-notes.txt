******Js Basic******
js order of operation -> 1st - (...) 2nd - * / 3rd - + - 4th - comparison operator(<>) 5th - logical operator;
concatination means combine some strings together
javascript adds left to right
for write string by default we use single quotes('),
css property- background-color:red  css value;
learn more about the attribute
<!DOCTYPE html> means modern type of html it's to a html
by default vs code added indent on code structure and that was 4 spaces
html and js er multiline comment same /**/
css comment <!---->
; means end of instraction
console.clear() console clear kora jai
know about variable reassignment shortcut;
	+=2 ---> variable = variable + 2
	++ ----> variable  = variable + 1;
	also we have *2, /2, --, -2,
camelCase is the standard for javascript;
PascalCase is only use in 1 features;
kebab-case  isn't work in javascript; it's only use in html css and file name;
snake_case, but isn't use in js;
const can't change it's value later like let;
we use let when we have to change the variable but by default we have to use the const;
we dont' use var in new javascript cause it's has so much issue

boolean value represent if a value true or false;
js e === or !== use insted of == or != cause then we also check the type
logical operatore let us combine boolean value;
a scope limits where vaiables exist;
scope helps us naming conflict;
javascript falsy values => false, 0, '', NaN, undefined, null
function let's us reuse our code
following the code line by line is called tracing the code
in function reutrn we get a value out of a function;
parameter puts value into function;

we can change the object property-value pair
product.name =  . this is called dot notation
object make our code more organized
we use bracket notation in object cause sometimes the dot notation doesn't work like when in a object a property name is in hypen, product-price: 599; that time we we the bracket notation product['product-price']
but use dot notation by default cause it's easy to use
Object + function = Method ex; console.log is a method, Math.random()
we called build-in object : console.log, Json, localStorage
JSON similar to js object but with less feature, not supported single quotes and inside the function	
JSON is more universal, every programming language understand
json => js object = JSON.parse();
js object => json = JSON.stringify(); also we can make anything string with the JSON.stringify()
localStorage support only string;
when something doesn't exist in localStorage it's give => null
!score same as score === null
object references is confusing and it's don't compare the value it's only references the object
destructuring with {}, 
The document object represent the webpage
Method = function saved inside an object
document.querySelector() - lets us get any element from the page and put it inside javascript
innerHTML = change the inside element of the body
but jodi 2ta btn thake sekane querySelector only get first btn.
js diye jodi kono class use kora hoy se class ta lekar age js lika best practise, js-button
querySelector() amra sob element, class, id select korthe pari
innerHTML diye kono element er text k select korle sei element e jodi space thake tahole problem hoy, ejonno amra innerText use korbo
input e access korle dom e input er innterText na diye value dite hobe (numbers)
